Data are currently provided as private for peer review only. Please email Ethan (ecissell@unc.edu) for permissions to use data and/or code prior to acceptance of the manuscripts for publication.

Code files include:
- A combined R script used in the statistical analysis of all data and for generating plots (.R)
- The code for the bioinformatic analysis of the viral data (.txt)
- The code for the metacommunity cellular automaton models (.C)


Data files include:
- Benthic cover data of cyanobacterial mat metacommunities across time (.csv)
- Survival data from the field coring experiment (.csv)
- Fish foraging data (.csv)
- Model output dataframe (.csv; Please email Ethan [ecissell@unc.edu] for access due to large file size preventing upload)
- The vDeath database - a curated database of viral sequences recovered from a dying cyanobacterial mat (.fasta, .faa, .genes). 
- Abundances (as TPM normalized counts) of every recovered vOTU across the sampled decaying cyanobacterial mat (.csv)
