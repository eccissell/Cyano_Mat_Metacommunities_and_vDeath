Code and data files for:

Cissell EC, McCoy SJ. In Review. Heterogeneous predation, community asynchrony, and metacommunity stability in cyanobacterial mats (Preprint Available Here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.07.511315v2) 

and 

Cissell EC, McCoy SJ. Viral association with cyanobacterial mat community mortality. Ecology. 2023 Sep;104(9):e4131. doi: 10.1002/ecy.4131 (Link: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.4131). 

Code files include:
- A combined R script used in the statistical analysis of all data and for generating plots ('Combined_Master_Script.R')
- The code for the bioinformatic analysis of the viral data ('Curated_Death_Virus_Workflow.txt')

Data files include:
- Benthic cover data of cyanobacterial mat metacommunity across time ('metacommunity_BCM_benthic_df.csv')
- Survival data from the field coring experiment ('coring_experiment_df.csv')
- Fish foraging data ('fish_bites_df.csv')
- The vDeath database - a curated database of viral sequences recovered from a dying cyanobacterial mat ('vDeath.fasta', 'vDeath.faa', 'vDeath.genes'). 
- Abundances (as TPM normalized counts) of every recovered vOTU across the sampled decaying cyanobacterial mat ('vdeath_abunds.csv')
